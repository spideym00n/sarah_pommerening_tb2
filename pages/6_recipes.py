    **Chicken Avocado Wrap**
    
   - 2 chicken breasts, cooked and sliced
   - 6 large burrito size tortillas
   - 3 cups lettuce, chopped
   - 1 large tomato, diced
   - 1 avocado diced
   - 3 cups yellow sharp cheddar cheese, grated
   - 1 cup sour cream (optional)

Season and cook the chicken breast to your liking. Once done, slice the cooked or grilled chicken, chop lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado, and grate a cheese of your choice. Fill the wrap with all the ingredients and wrap it tightly so that it does not fall apart once you heat it in a pan. You can also skip his step and eat them cold. Of course you can switch the ingredients with any proteins and vegetables of your choice. Dips or dressings that work well with this recipe are sour cream, american dressing or hummus.

    **Easy and cheap no-yeast pizza**
   - 400g tin chopped tomatoes
   - 1 tsp dried mixed herbs, plus extra for topping
   - 2 pinches sugar
   - 1 garlic clove
   - 200g mozzarella (or any other cheese), torn into pieces, for topping
   - salt and pepper
   - 300g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
   - 1 tsp baking powder
   - ½ tsp salt
   - 300g natural yoghurt
   - other toppings (optional)
   

Preheat the oven to 220°C and put two baking trays in to heat.
To make the sauce, put the tomatoes, mixed herbs and sugar in a saucepan. Peel and finely grate the garlic, add it to the pan and set over a medium heat. Simmer gently for 10 minutes until thickened then remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. Leave to cool.
To make the dough, combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl and make a well in the middle. Pour in the yoghurt the stir with a fork to combine.
When the mixture forms a rough dough, turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead to form a smooth ball. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll out into thin circles.
Carefully remove the hot baking trays from the oven and lay the pizza bases on top. Bake for 3-4 minutes until beginning to rise then remove from the oven.
Turn the pizza bases over and top with the sauce. Scatter the mozzarella over the top. Season with black pepper, sprinkle over a pinch of herbs then return to the oven. Bake for 5 minutes until the bases are crisp and the cheese is bubbling.

    **Spaghetti bolognese with hidden veggies**
   - 1 onion, roughly chopped
   - 1 carrot, peeled, finely grated
   - 1 courgette, trimmed, finely grated
   - 1 red pepper, deseeded, thinly sliced
   - 500g beef mince
   - 400g tin chopped tomatoes
   - 2 tbsp tomato paste
   - 1 tsp dried oregano or dried mixed herbs
   - 1 beef stock cube
   - 1 bay leaf
   - 300g dried spaghetti
   - salt and pepper


Put the vegetables in a large, heavy-based saucepan and cover with 500ml/18fl oz water. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until the onion and pepper are very soft. Remove from the heat and blend the contents to a smooth purée using a hand-held blender. Set aside and keep warm.
Heat a separate, non-stick, lidded saucepan over a medium heat. Dry-fry the beef mince for 3-5 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up any large clumps, until lightly browned on the outside.
Add the puréed vegetables, chopped tomatoes, tomato purée and dried herbs to the pan, stirring well to combine. Crumble over the stock cube and add the bay leaf. Season with pepper and stir again.
Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat until it is simmering. Half-cover the pan with the lid and continue to simmer gently for 25-30 minutes, stirring the sauce more and more regularly as it thickens.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente.
Divide the spaghetti between bowls and top with the bolognese sauce. Season with black pepper and Parmesan.
